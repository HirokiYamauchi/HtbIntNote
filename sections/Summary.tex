\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:Summary}

We have performed a search for charged Higgs boson $H^{+}$ as well as $W'$ bosons produced in association with a top quark and a bottom quark, and decaying into a top quark and a bottom quark, in the lepton-plus-jets final state, in the regime where the top quark from the parent boson is highly boosted to be reconstructed as a top-tagged large-$R$ jet. The mass range $1000 < m_{H^{+}} < 3000$~GeV is investigated. Expected upper cross section limits between 0.073 pb and 0.011 pb were set. 

{\textcolor{red}{Limits for $W'$ is to be finalized.}}
