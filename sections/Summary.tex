\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:Summary}

We have performed a search for charged Higgs boson $H^{+}$ as well as $W'$ bosons produced in association with a top quark and a bottom quark, and decaying into a top quark and a bottom quark, in the lepton-plus-jets final state, in the regime where the top quark from the parent boson is highly boosted to be reconstructed as a top-tagged large-$R$ jet. The $H^{+}$ signals are investigated in the mass ranges of $1000 \leq m_{H^{+}} \leq 5000$~GeV, while The $W'$ signals are done in the mass range of $1000 \leq m_{W'_{\text{L/R}}} \leq 4000$~GeV. The expected upper limits for $H^{+}$ signals are set between 0.0958 to 0.0069 pb. The ones for $W'_{\text{L}}$ ($W'_{\text{R}}$) are set between 0.1743 (0.1111) to 0.0080 (0.0060) pb.
